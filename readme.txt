ALPHA VERSION v0.1.3

This game is still in an early state of development, so you will probably face
some bugs when playing it. The SCP Facility is also quite empty at the moment,
and it isn't possible to get out and "win the game" yet.

The game is based on the SCP Foundation stories (http://www.scp-wiki.net/).
